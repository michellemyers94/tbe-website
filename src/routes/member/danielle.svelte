        <p class="member-bio">As a classically-trained harpist, <span class="tbe-podcast">DANIELLE KUNTZ</span> (she/her) has always gravitated toward new and under performed music. Fueled by her desire to make the harp more accessible to non-harpist composers, she has built a growing library of harp writing resources. Her YouTube channel is followed by composers and orchestrators around the world and includes tutorial videos on writing for the harp and reviews of standard harp excerpts. Danielle also works with composers to assist them in refining their harp writing. She regularly commissions new music and has premiered numerous compositions in both live and virtual settings. Recent collaborators include Griffin Candey, Kincaid Rabb, and Michael Kahle. Danielle is also the harpist for the Midwest-based new music ensemble, The_____Experiment. </p>
