## The Blank Experiment
This repo contains the code for the new music ensemble, The _____ Experiment's website, coded by Michelle Myers-Cusick (me).

### Stack
This site was coded using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and contains images owned by Michelle Myers-Cusick.

### Process
The first part completed was making a sitemap and flow chart of how the ensemble wanted the site to be laid out, and
features were wanted on the site.

From there, I went to work to on creating wireframes and designing the UI for the site using Adobe XD.
